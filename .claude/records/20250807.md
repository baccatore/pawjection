- Clear statistics option with confirmation

### 4. Enhanced UX

## Critical Bug Fix

### Issue: "Take Quiz Again" Loading State Bug
**Problem:** Clicking "Take Quiz Again" caused endless loading spinner

**Root Cause:** `showLoadingState()` replaced entire `.quiz-content` innerHTML, destroying DOM structure needed for quiz

**Solution:** Modified `initializeQuiz()` function to:
1. Check if quiz DOM elements exist
2. Restore complete quiz structure if missing
3. Re-cache element references
4. Re-attach event listeners

```javascript
// Fixed code in app.js:386-425
if (!document.getElementById('question-container')) {
  quizContent.innerHTML = `[quiz structure HTML]`;
  // Re-cache and re-attach listeners
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **public/app.js** - Core logic, features, bug fix
2. **public/index.html** - Added modals, share buttons, updated text
3. **public/styles.css** - Styling for all new features

### Key Design Decisions
- localStorage for statistics persistence (client-side only)
- Modal overlays for stats and breed explorer
- CSS animations for enhanced UX
- Personality scoring based on dominant traits across questions

## Testing Status
- All features working correctly
- Bug fix verified - quiz can be retaken multiple times
- Social sharing tested and functional
- Statistics persist across sessions
- Breed explorer navigation works smoothly
